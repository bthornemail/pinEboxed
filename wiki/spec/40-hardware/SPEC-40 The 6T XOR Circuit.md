# The 6T XOR Circuit

## Definition

From `rosetta/src/omi_rosetta_stone.yaml`:

```yaml
circuit_6t:
  description: "The 6T XOR circuit (XOR #2, the apply, the full fan-out)."
  canvas_id: "6t-xor"
  canvas_version: "1.0"
```

The 6T XOR circuit is the **apply** — the full fan-out. It is the second XOR gate in the protocol's physical realization.

## The Truth Table

The 6T circuit computes XOR. The truth table:

| A | B | OUT |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

## The Naming Collision

**Important:** The 6T and 8T in the protocol's YAML spec are BJT breadboard circuits, not CMOS. The reference source (SRC-08) describes 5T, 6T, 8T, and 10T BJT circuits. There is a naming collision: the "6T" in the YAML is a BJT circuit with 6 transistors, while "6T" in CMOS literature typically means 6 transistors in a CMOS XOR gate. These are different circuits.

## The 6T as Apply

The 6T circuit is the **apply** — the full fan-out. It is the second XOR gate in the protocol's physical realization. The 5T is the first (the frame condition), the 6T is the second (the apply), the 8T is the third (the eval), and the 10T is the fourth (the digest).

```
5T   →  the frame condition (read)
6T   →  the apply (full fan-out)
8T   →  the eval (SECURE)
10T  →  the digest (reads and drives)
```

## The Contradiction

From the extraction of SRC-02: the 6T is XNOR, not XOR. `Atom.apply()` returns 254/255. This is a genuine contradiction — the circuit as described does not compute XOR. See [[OPEN-00 Contradiction Register]].
